# RoadWare - Drive Safe

#### ITC Smart Cities Hackathon 2023

#### Group 4
**Full Stack**: Noa Sela , Reem Cohen , Shlomo Z

**Data Science**: Maxim Shatzki, Eliott Caen, Maya Halevy

### Problem
We developed RoadWare to address the issue of road safety and incorporate this into popular navigation services. Currently, drivers are provided with the fastest route from point A to point B. But what if speed is not your only concern? 
With RoadWare you have options. 

### Functionality
Our app connects to the Google Maps API and provides the user with two route options, highlighted in various danger levels low, medium, and high. These danger levels are calculated by implementing machine learning models to calculate the density of car accidents at that point, normalized by the flow of traffic.

Note: This was a 2-day hackathon, and we are presenting the minimum viable product.

### Future Directions
We envision our model being a useful feature of Google Maps or Waze. 
The model currently works in New York, as this is where our data was collected. We see this app being useful in any city where the relevant data is available. Additionally, there is the potential to build more sophisticated models that take in user vehicle type, time of day, and day of the week. We are also interested in presenting to users the most relevant dangers in their current area. For example, in some areas it may be more relevant to pay attention to pedestrians, whereas in others large trucks or motorcyclists may be the most likely dangers.
